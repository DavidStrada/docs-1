title: Add to cart link
---
{{ noparse }}
Outputs an encrypted link to add a product to the cart.

This is useful when you want to add a product with an on-the-fly price to the cart. It is encrypted because you don't want to be able to let your customers change the price of *any* product on your site.

### Parameters
`product`
: The URL of the product to add.

`quantity`
: How many to add?

`price`
: What should it cost?

`option`
: The index of the product modifier.

`extra`
: Extra data to make the cart item unique. Pipe delimited, colon separated values, eg. `size:small|color:red`

`return`
: The URL to be shown after the item is added.

`error_return`
: The URL to be shown if there is a problem adding the item.

### Example
You probably would want to link to a template with an [add to cart tag](#add_to_cart) on it.
~~~
{{ bison:add_to_cart_link url="/cart/add" product="/donation" quantity="1" price="10" return="/cart" }}
Outputs: /cart/add?item=encryptedstring
