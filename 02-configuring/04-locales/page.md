title: Locales
---
When using location based tags such as the [country select tag](/docs/tags/utilities#country_select), the countries are auto-generated from a list found in `_config/add-ons/bison/locales.yaml`.

If you want to modify the countries that are output, you can use your own custom locales list by renaming `_config/add-ons/bison/_custom_locales.yaml` to `custom_locales.yaml`. This will make sure your custom locales won't get overridden if/when you update Bison.
