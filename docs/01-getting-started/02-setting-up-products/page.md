title: Setting up products
---
Products in Bison are entries in a folder.

### Product folder
In your configuration file, make sure `product_folder` is set to the appropriate folder.

### Price field
You will need to add a price field (field name is configurable) to your entries.  

If you are editing your content files manually, simply add a price field to your YAML front-matter.
If you are using the control panel, you should add the price field to your fieldset. You may like to use the included [price fieldtype](/docs/fieldtypes#price).

For more advanced pricing options, check out [item options and price modifiers](/docs/getting-started/item-options).
